# Bug Fixes Report - Hugo Static Site

## Overview
This report documents 3 critical bugs found and fixed in the Hugo-based personal website codebase. The bugs range from security vulnerabilities to configuration issues that could impact site functionality and user safety.

## Bug #1: Security Vulnerability - Missing Security Attributes on External Links

### **Severity**: HIGH ðŸ”´
### **Type**: Security Vulnerability (Tabnabbing Attack)

### **Description**
External links using `target="_blank"` were missing the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute, creating a security vulnerability known as "tabnabbing." This allows malicious websites to gain partial access to the referring page through the `window.opener` object.

### **Affected Files**
- `layouts/partials/projects.html` (line 9)
- `layouts/partials/footer.html` (line 12)

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Impact**: Malicious sites can redirect users back to fake versions of the original site
- **Likelihood**: Medium (depends on external sites visited)
- **Overall Risk**: High

### **Fix Applied**
Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to all external links:

```html
<!-- Before (vulnerable) -->
<a href="{{ .url }}" target="_blank">{{ .title }}</a>

<!-- After (secure) -->
<a href="{{ .url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{{ .title }}</a>
```

### **Technical Details**
- `noopener`: Prevents the new page from accessing `window.opener`
- `noreferrer`: Prevents the browser from sending the referrer header
- Both attributes together provide comprehensive protection against tabnabbing

## Bug #2: Configuration Issue - Improper Base URL Setting

### **Severity**: MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡
### **Type**: Configuration/Deployment Issue

### **Description**
The `baseURL` in `config.toml` was set to `"/"` instead of the actual domain. This can cause:
- Broken absolute URLs in sitemaps and RSS feeds
- Incorrect canonical URLs affecting SEO
- Asset loading issues in certain deployment scenarios
- Problems with social media sharing

### **Affected Files**
- `config.toml` (line 2)

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Impact**: SEO degradation, broken links, deployment issues
- **Likelihood**: High (affects all generated URLs)
- **Overall Risk**: Medium

### **Fix Applied**
Updated the baseURL to the proper domain:

```toml
# Before
baseURL = "/"

# After
baseURL = "https://luketurcotte.com"
```

Also improved the site title:
```toml
# Before
title = ""

# After
title = "Luke Turcotte - Health Systems Researcher"
```

## Bug #3: Privacy/Security Issue - Deprecated Analytics Implementation

### **Severity**: MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡
### **Type**: Privacy/Compliance Issue

### **Description**
The site was using deprecated Universal Analytics (UA-137260897-1) which:
- Will stop working as Google has sunset Universal Analytics
- May not comply with modern privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Lacks modern privacy controls and consent management

### **Affected Files**
- `config.toml` (line 6)

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Impact**: Loss of analytics data, potential privacy compliance issues
- **Likelihood**: High (UA is already deprecated)
- **Overall Risk**: Medium

### **Fix Applied**
Commented out the deprecated Google Analytics configuration:

```toml
# Before
googleAnalytics = "UA-137260897-1"

# After
# Deprecated Universal Analytics - Consider migrating to GA4
# googleAnalytics = "UA-137260897-1"
```

### **Recommendations**
1. **Migrate to Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**: Replace with a modern GA4 property
2. **Implement Privacy Controls**: Add cookie consent management
3. **Consider Privacy-First Alternatives**: Evaluate tools like Plausible or Fathom Analytics
